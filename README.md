In this assignment I had to create a shooting game using the code that was provided. Some things that was missing from the program was generating bullets and being able to kill the penguins with the bullets. To do this I had to add some code to lines 95 and 76. Line 76 allowed me to decrease the health of the penguin and increase our narwahls score. On lines 95 I also added some coding which allowed me to generate bullets by clicking the mouse.
